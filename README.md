# OVA Assignment Report  

## Introduction  
This document outlines the approach taken to solve the OVA AI Developer assignment.  

## Approach  
1. **Data Preprocessing**:  
   - Cleaned the dataset to remove duplicates and missing values.  
   - Performed feature extraction for candidate skills.  

2. **Model Building**:  
   - Implemented a logistic regression model for skill matching.  
   - Used TF-IDF for text feature extraction from candidate resumes.  

3. **Output Generation**:  
   - Ranked candidates based on the job requirements and saved the output in CSV format.  

## Challenges  
- Handling missing data.  
- Optimizing the model for accurate results.  

## Future Work  
- Deployment of the system as a web application.  
- Using pre-trained models for NLP-based skill matching.
